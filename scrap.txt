for it is not oour fault that the world is the way it is. no, but the world we
inherit need not be the world we leave for our children to inherit. for the
mindset of people changes and so do what is accepted in society, but that is
all too subjective. the laws of men is efemerous when compared to the laws of
nature. it is then our task to question all there is, that was created and
implemented by men, for some of it is good and some of it is outdated. it is
our duty for us and the generation next that we get rid of most vanities and
addictios that inebriate us into thinking this is the way things should be, for
they have always been like that. Man's life in this planet has only taken for a
very short span of time. we must not forget what was here before us, and still
is. The anxety of time and money which drive our societies is nothing but a
mere illusion. that is not the reality of Life, for that cages and limits us,
when Life is much more.
